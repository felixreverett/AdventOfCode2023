# Objectives of Advent of Code 2023:
- I've opted to use the Advent Of Code 2023 as a starting point for learning my third programming language JavaScript.

## Check out these days:
- Day 9a/b:
  - I abstracted my solution into a separate class which calculates its own next value in the sequence. For part b I simply reversed the array to find the "previous" value.
- Day X0a:
  - While I found the solution quite quickly, I went back and reworked my less-than-ideal code to a solution I'm ultimately happy with. This intensive debugging was very satisfying.

## Notable practices I've learnt:
- **maps** (day 7)
